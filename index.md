# Introduction
The rise of e-commerce has transformed the way goods move across the world, and China stands at the forefront of this digital retail revolution. With billions of packages delivered every year, the country's logistics network has become one of the most complex and high-volume systems globally. But what does the scenario look like really up close?

For our project, we want to explore Shanghai â€“ a city where the pulse of online shopping beats fast and loud. Itâ€™s one of the worldâ€™s busiest and most complex urban structure, with crowded streets, tall skyscrapers, and a blend of old neighborhoods and shiny new business districts. With its dense population, high spending power, and rapidly changing neighborhoods, delivery drivers must navigate a maze of tight lanes, traffic jams, and income divides.

In this data story, we'll dive deep into the complexities of Shanghai's delivery ecosystem, uncovering patterns in volume, speed, timing, and geography to shed light on what makes this massive logistical machine tick. 

The following image is a bar chart with data sourced from the [China State Post Bureau](https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/08/27/china-tech-giant-alibaba-says-delivery-robots-are-the-future-here-are-4-charts-that-explai). It shows the rapid growth in package deliveries in China from 2013 to 2020. The bars are colored in a bright orange, increasing steadily each year, reflecting the explosive rise in e-commerce over the past decade. The chart highlights how parcel volumes surged from just over 10 billion in 2013 to nearly 80 billion in 2020, emphasizing the scale of Chinaâ€™s booming online shopping industry.
