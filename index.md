# Intro 
Online shopping has changed the way we buy things, with billions of packages moving every day â€“ from sneakers to smartphones â€“ reaching doorsteps within hours. China, as one of the biggest e-commerce powerhouses, stands right at the center of this global delivery boom. But what does this rapid growth look like up close?

To explore this, we chose Shanghai â€“ a city where the pulse of online shopping beats fast and loud. Itâ€™s one of the worldâ€™s busiest and most complex urban jungles, with crowded streets, tall skyscrapers, and a blend of old neighborhoods and shiny new business districts. Itâ€™s a place where a single street can connect bustling shops, quiet residential blocks, and towering office buildings â€“ each with its own delivery story.

But this complexity also makes Shanghai a challenging city for logistics. With its dense population, high spending power, and rapidly changing neighborhoods, delivery drivers must navigate a maze of tight lanes, traffic jams, and income divides. Itâ€™s a city that never stops, where the flow of parcels is as constant as the hustle of its people.


The following image is a bar chart with data sourced from the China State Post Bureau [Link](https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/08/27/china-tech-giant-alibaba-says-delivery-robots-are-the-future-here-are-4-charts-that-explai). It shows the rapid growth in package deliveries in China from 2013 to 2020. The bars are colored in a bright orange, increasing steadily each year, reflecting the explosive rise in e-commerce over the past decade. The chart highlights how parcel volumes surged from just over 10 billion in 2013 to nearly 80 billion in 2020, emphasizing the scale of Chinaâ€™s booming online shopping industry.
