# The Other Side of the Bay: Two Decades of Weapon Crimes in San Francisco

San Francisco is many things — a tourist magnet, a tech hub, and home to some of the most vibrant neighborhoods in the United States. Yet, like every major city, San Francisco also carries the quiet burden of crime. While headlines often focus on sensational stories, the real trends often hide in plain sight, recorded steadily by the San Francisco Police Department for years.

In this data story, we explore the complexities of San Francisco's crime landscape. Starting from the broad picture of crime in general, we gradually zoom into a category that holds particular social significance in US — Weapon Law Violations. With nearly two decades of data (2004–2024) at hand, this article doesn't just display number but it also uncover patterns, rhythms, and shifts that might change the way you see the city.

Before we dive into San Francisco’s crime story, it’s important to give credit where it’s due. The dataset used here comes straight from the San Francisco Police Department’s open data portal, covering crime incidents from 2003 to 2024.

It’s not exactly bedtime reading, but for data enthusiasts, it’s a treasure trove. From minor vandalism to serious weapon offenses, the dataset captures the city’s streets in numbers. So here’s a friendly nod (and maybe a virtual donut) to the SFPD for making this data public — without it, this story would have been far less exciting to tell!

## Crimes in San Francisco : The Rise and The Fall

Before we focus on weapon-related crimes, it's worth glancing at the broader crime canvas of San Francisco. Over the past two decades, patterns have shifted, reflecting the city’s changing laws, economy, and urban life. Drug-related offenses, for example, saw a sharp decline after 2011, following California’s policy reforms, while prostitution-related cases nearly vanished post-2015. Assaults and robberies, once frequent, gradually declined, but larceny and theft lingered stubbornly, only dipping when the pandemic emptied the streets. These trends hint at a city constantly reshaping itself under the push and pull of policy, social change, and everyday life.

## Why Weapons Deserve a Spotlight (And Not Just in Action Movies)

Weapon-related crimes aren’t just another line item in the crime stats — they carry weight, both literally and figuratively. Unlike vandalism or petty theft, these incidents often stir debates, influence public policies, and shape how safe people feel in their neighborhoods.

Behind every data point might be a loaded question: Are communities feeling safer? Are gun policies working? Are inequalities widening? Weapon offenses touch all these themes and more.

By focusing on weapon-related crimes, we’re not just counting incidents — we’re listening to the pulse of urban safety, understanding fears, tensions, and the fabric of daily life in San Francisco.
