# Exploring AOI Types Across Different Zones â€“ Interactive Insights

To capture the diverse character of Shanghai, we grouped its 16 administrative districts into broader zone groups based on population density, economic activity, and infrastructure. The Central Urban Core includes high-density, high-income areas like Huangpu, Jing'an, Xuhui, and Changning, known for their financial hubs and luxury shopping streets. The Expanding Urban Core covers fast-growing districts like Pudong New Area and Minhang, which are home to tech parks and modern business centers. Inner Suburbs like Baoshan, Jiading, and Fengxian balance residential and industrial activity, while Outer Suburbs like Songjiang, Jinshan, and Qingpu include quieter residential communities and large-scale manufacturing hubs. Finally, Rural and Isolated Areas like Chongming stand apart, characterized by lower population density and agricultural landscapes.

Grouping these districts helps us see how delivery patterns and purchase power vary across the city. Taller bars in these plots generally indicate areas with higher economic activity and stronger purchase power, while shorter bars might reflect residential or industrial zones with less frequent orders.
