# Exploring AOI Types Across Different Zones – Interactive Insights

To capture the diverse character of Shanghai, we grouped its 16 administrative districts into broader zone groups based on population density, economic activity, and infrastructure. The Central Urban Core includes high-density, high-income areas like Huangpu, Jing'an, Xuhui, and Changning, known for their financial hubs and luxury shopping streets. The Expanding Urban Core covers fast-growing districts like Pudong New Area and Minhang, which are home to tech parks and modern business centers. Inner Suburbs like Baoshan, Jiading, and Fengxian balance residential and industrial activity, while Outer Suburbs like Songjiang, Jinshan, and Qingpu include quieter residential communities and large-scale manufacturing hubs. Finally, Rural and Isolated Areas like Chongming stand apart, characterized by lower population density and agricultural landscapes.

Grouping these districts helps us see how delivery patterns and purchase power vary across the city. Taller bars in these plots generally indicate areas with higher economic activity and stronger purchase power, while shorter bars might reflect residential or industrial zones with less frequent orders.

## AOI Patterns Across Zones – What to Look For
When you select the Central Urban Core, you’ll notice that Mixed-Use and Business Hubs dominate the scene. This makes sense, as these areas include dense commercial districts like Jing’an and Huangpu, where businesses, offices, and high-rise apartments are tightly packed, creating a constant flow of deliveries.
Switching to the Outer Suburbs reveals a different picture, with Warehousing and Industrial Zones becoming more prominent. These areas, like Songjiang and Jinshan, serve as the city’s logistics backbone, handling bulk shipments and acting as critical nodes in the supply chain.


## Delivery Times Within the Same Zone
After identifying the broader AOI patterns across Shanghai’s different zones, it’s clear that each area has its own unique delivery dynamics. But volume alone doesn’t tell the full story – we also need to consider delivery times and how they vary across different AOI types within the same zone.
In the Expanding Urban Core (like Pudong and Minhang), Business Hubs often handle high volumes but also face longer average delivery times. This is likely due to dense office clusters, complex road networks, and high traffic volumes. However, Mixed-Use areas in the same zone tend to have shorter delivery times despite high volumes, benefiting from more efficient routes and better infrastructure, which allow for faster, more direct deliveries.
In the Outer Suburbs (like Songjiang and Qingpu), the pattern flips. Industrial Zones here handle high volumes but often manage to keep delivery times shorter, thanks to wide roads, less congestion, and more optimized bulk shipments. On the other hand, Residential Areas in these suburbs might see fewer but slower deliveries, as narrow streets, complex housing layouts, and lower route optimization slow down couriers.
