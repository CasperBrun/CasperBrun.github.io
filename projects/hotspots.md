# From Time to Territory – Mapping the Hotspots
After exploring the temporal and hourly patterns, it’s clear that delivery demand in Shanghai follows a distinct rhythm, peaking during certain hours and months. But to truly understand where the pressure points lie, we need to move beyond just when deliveries happen and start looking at where they happen.
This naturally leads us to the next phase – spatial analysis. This is where our hotspot maps come in, highlighting the most active delivery regions and the possible factors driving these patterns.

*This interactive heatmap highlights the busiest regions in red and orange, while cooler tones like blue indicate lower delivery volumes. Use this map to explore different districts, zoom in to the street level, or pan across the city to find interesting patterns.*

- **Heart of the Action – Central Core**
As you move your cursor over the city center, you’ll notice Huangpu, Pudong, and Xuhui glowing in deep red. These are Shanghai’s economic powerhouses, home to financial hubs like Lujiazui in Pudong, and bustling retail streets like Nanjing Road in Huangpu. According to [China Daily](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202308/19/WS64dfb3f4a31035260b81cffa.html), Lujiazui alone drives a massive share of the city’s economic activity, making it a prime delivery zone.

- **Busy Suburbs – Minhang**
If you scroll slightly to the southwest, you’ll find Minhang, another high-intensity zone. Known for its dense residential clusters, shopping centers, and logistics hubs.

- **Residential and Commercial Hubs – Xuhui and Huangpu**
Moving a bit to the west, you’ll see the hotspots in Xuhui, home to the bustling Huaihai Road and high-density residential neighborhoods. These areas benefit from a well-connected metro and elevated road network, like the Yan’an Elevated Road, which speeds up last-mile deliveries ([Shanghai Metro, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Metro)), that can justify a  high volume of delivery.

- **Cooler, Calmer Outskirts**
As you pan further out to the **west** and **northwest**, the colors start to cool. Districts like **Songjiang**, **Qingpu**, and **Jiading** have lighter tones, reflecting their more suburban character. These areas typically focus on **manufacturing**, **warehousing**, and **bulk cargo**, resulting in lower parcel density and longer average delivery times.
