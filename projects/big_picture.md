<iframe src="/assets/interactive/stacked_bar_with_legend.html" width="100%" height="600px" style="border:none;"></iframe>

Bringing all zone groups together, this stacked bar chart captures the full spectrum of Shanghai’s delivery dynamics. High-density, high-income areas like the Central Urban Core and Expanding Urban Core show strong volumes in Business Hubs and Mixed-Use zones, reflecting intense commercial activity and higher purchasing power. Meanwhile, Outer Suburbs and Rural Areas lean more towards Warehousing, Postal Centers, and Residential Areas, reflecting their roles in supporting long-distance logistics and bulk shipments.
With this, we wrap up our exploration, revealing how zone types, infrastructure, and consumer behavior come together to shape the complex world of last-mile delivery in Shanghai.
