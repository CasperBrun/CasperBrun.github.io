# Congestion Map : Where Speed Meets Pressure 
After finding the busiest delivery zones, the next step is to see **how fast** couriers can actually move through them. High volume doesn’t always mean slow speeds, and quiet areas can still have traffic challenges. Mapping congestion helps us spot these real-world delivery obstacles.

- **Slow Zones – High Pressure, Low Speed**:

Zoom into the city center, and you’ll find dense, slow zones like Changning and Hongqiao, where speeds often dip below 2.0 km/h. These areas are packed with offices, residential blocks, and major transit hubs, creating constant traffic jams and frequent stops.


- **Medium Speed Zones – Balancing the Load**:

Moving slightly **west**, areas like **Xujing** and **Gumei** show medium speeds. These are transitional zones, blending residential and industrial traffic, which can slow things down even without extreme volumes.


- **Fast Zones – Open Roads, High Speeds**:

As you pan out to the suburbs, zones like Gangqiao, Zhoupu, and Sheshan stand out with speeds above 4.0 km/h. These areas benefit from fewer stops, wider roads, and proximity to major highways like the G1503 Ring Expressway.

*Interestingly enough, despite being further from the city center, these zones often handle lower volumes but still maintain higher speeds, showing that distance alone doesn’t determine congestion, rather traffic inside the busy urban zone does.*

We  can surely conclude that, AOI types clearly influence speed, with postal centers and business complexes often achieving higher speeds, while mixed-use and residential zones face more frequent delays.


- **Get Closer – Explore the Details**:

*As you zoom in further, individual delivery points reveal detailed information on AOI types, average speeds, and delivery volumes. Use this to uncover surprising slow spots even in the outer districts, where complex traffic or waterway barriers can still slow things down.*
